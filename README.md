# Matlab movement data labeling tool
A set of Matlab scipts that can be used synchronize time-series data with videos and manually annotate (label) the data.

The files inside the 'Labels' folder are required to change the label options, and camera names.
Therefore all files inside the Labels folder must be copied to the folder where the labels are stored.
sensor_camera_offsets.csv and video_time_sync_info.csv are files that are used to store offsets between the sensors and cameras.

To start labeling, run data_labeling.m in Matlab
